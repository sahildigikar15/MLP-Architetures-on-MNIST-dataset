1] As dropout is increased from 0.2 to 0.5 with same batch size and architecture , number of epoch needed starts increasing<br>
2] After reaching the particular epoch the model overfits.<br>
3] When we dont apply BatchNormalization, no. of epoch becomes 4 after which the model starts overfitting.<br>
4] For 5 Hidden Layers with dropout = 0.5 , epoch reached maximum which is 50.<br>
5] All the test Accuracy is in the range of (98 - 98.5) %<br>
6] For models without BatchNormalization we got less test accuracy of approx 97 %<br>
